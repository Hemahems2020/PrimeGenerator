Steps to run the code

1. Make sure you have a folder C:/Users/SquareH or change to the appropriate folder location in application.properties under src/main/resources.

2. Start the Application
to start from eclipse - Go to src/main/java com.rest.webservices.restfulwebservices/RestfulWbServicesApplication.java->right click->Run As->Java Application.
to start from jar - download the jar file demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar and in command prompt run the jar file as java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

3. To access H2 database
Open browser and type "http://localhost:9090/h2/".
Sign in username = hema and password = hema
Database username = hema and password = blank -- this is set b default so just press "Connect"

4. To access prime number program
(Note: Different strategies available
* Type "Traditional" below for Traditional Approach of Prime Number calculation
* Type "BruteForce" for Brute Force Method
* Type "SieveOfEratosthenes" for Sieve Of Eratosthenes Method)
Open browser and type "http://localhost:9090/hello-bean/Path-variable/<lowerlimit>,<upperlimit>,<strategy>"
e.g., http://localhost:9090/hello-bean/Path-variable/10,250,SieveOfEratosthenes

5. Run the prime number generator code as many times as possible and check the results in the database
SELECT * from PRIME;
